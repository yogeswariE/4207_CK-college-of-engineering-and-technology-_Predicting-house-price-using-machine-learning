Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
Python 3.x: You can download Python from python.org.
Pip: A package manager for Python. It usually comes with Python installation.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/pavikiru203/4207_CK-college-of-engineering-and-technology_Predicting-house-price-using-machine-leaning.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data
Before you can use the code, you need to provide your dataset. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain columns for various features and the target variable (house prices).
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing
Training the Model
To train the machine learning model, use the following command:
python train.py --data data/your_dataset.csv --model saved_models/model_name.pkl
--data: Specify the path to your dataset.
--model: Choose a name for your trained model and specify a path to save it.
This will preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train a model using default hyperparameters. You can customize the hyperparameters by modifying the train.py script.
Making Predictions
To make predictions on new data using your trained model, use the following command:
python predict.py --data data/new_data.csv --model saved_models/model_name.pkl --output predictions/predictions.csv
--data: Specify the path to your new data.
--model: Specify the path to your trained model.
--output: Choose a name for the predictions file and specify a path to save it.
This will load the model, preprocess the new data, and save the predictions in the specified output file.
Evaluation
You can evaluate the model's performance using the following command:
python evaluate.py --data data/your_dataset.csv --model saved_models/model_name.pkl
--data: Specify the path to your dataset.
--model: Specify the path to your trained model.
This will calculate and display evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Certainly, here's a concise description with a placeholder for the dataset source that you can use in your GitHub README file:
